 <h1>Getting Started with Quantum Computer Simulation</h1>

<h2>Step 1: Installing Rust and Cargo</h2>
<p>
    Before we begin, let's make sure that Rust and the Cargo package manager are installed on your computer.
    If not, you can download and install them by following the instructions at this link:
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</a>.
    <br>
    Now, let's move on to the next step.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Downloading the q1tsim Library for Quantum Computer Simulation</h2>
<p>
    To simulate quantum computers, we'll use the q1tsim library. You can download this library and find more
    detailed information about it by visiting this link:
    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/q1tsim/0.5.0">https://crates.io/crates/q1tsim/0.5.0</a>.
    <br>
    Let's proceed to the next step.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Gathering More Information on Quantum Computing</h2>
<p>
    To learn more about quantum computing, you can refer to the following links:
    <br>
    For general information about quantum computing:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing</a>.
    <br>
    For information about entangled electrons and quantum theory:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement</a>.
    <br>
    Feel free to explore these resources to gain a better understanding of quantum computing concepts.
    Let's proceed to the next step.

</p>

<h2>Step 4: Compiling the Project Using Cargo</h2>
<p>
    Open a new terminal window.
    <br>
    Navigate to the directory where your project is located. For example, in your case:
    <code>cd C:\Users\asimb\Desktop\visual studio\rust\Quantum_Computer_Simulation_With_rust_Q1tsim_lib</code>
    <br>
    Now, compile the project using Cargo:
    <code>cargo build</code>
    <br>
    You might encounter warnings during the compilation process. You can safely ignore these warnings.
    <br>
    Let's move on to the next step.
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Running the Compiled Code</h2>
<p>
    After the compilation process is complete, in the same terminal where you were before,
    enter the following command to run your code:
    <code>cargo run</code>
    <br>
    This command will execute your Rust code. If everything is set up correctly,
    you should see the output of your quantum computer simulation.
    <br>
    Congratulations! You've completed all the steps.
    If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask.
